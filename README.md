# Map-Questor
We are going to create a tool which all can use to find the
minimum or shortest path between two points. Also we
can use it in game development, shortest distance in map
etc. The Map Questor Algorithm Visualization Tool is an
ongoing project designed to provide users with an
interactive interface for visualizing various Map Questor
algorithms.
The primary goal of this project is to create an educational
and practical tool that helps users understand and
compare different pathfinding strategies and how to use
these different types of search in real life. We choose start
and end points and any restricted path and then find the
shortest path.

# Features:

## Algorithm Selection:**
Users can choose from a selection of
pathfinding algorithms, including Breadth-first search,
Depth-first search, Dijkstra Algorithm.

## Visualization:
The tool provides a visual representation of
how each algorithm explores the search space to find the
optimal path from a starting point to a target node. Users
can observe the step-by-step progress of the algorithm.

## Multiple End Nodes:
Users have the ability to add multiple
end nodes, allowing for the exploration of various paths
and scenarios. This feature enhances the tool's versatility.

## Clear Path:
We can also clear the past shortest path and
find a new path using this tool.
